    <h1>week 1 - time and habits</h1>
    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro technique</p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <h4>Tiny habits</h4>
    <p>One of my biggest challenges personally is trying to do too much at the same time.  Developping good tiny habits, and improving my time management with the Pomodoro technique are a good start</p>
    <h4>Pomodoro Technique</h4>
    <p>This technique works for me. 25 minute focus + 5 minute break. (repeat 3x) Take a 20 minute break.  Go again.</p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>I have been using Pomodoro in my day to day work since my last time at EDA.  Mindfulness meditation has helped to calm my doubtful mind and to remain at peace with m y own process - even being behind.</p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>Start small.  Use Pomodoro technique.  Make time to meditate.  Believe in myself.</p>
