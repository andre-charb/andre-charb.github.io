    <h1>week 1 - reflection</h1>
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>You get out of EDA, what you put into it.</p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>I like the program's structure and useful resources.</p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>To learn to code, you have to code.  I'm here to keep working at it, rather than not.</p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>I have no expectations on EDA.  I am only wish to commit myself to the work again and hope to be able to progress to Phase 1 if I can.  The program works if you work it.</p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>Yeah, love challenging myself in this space and hoping to find that I've retained some of what I learned the last time. Not nervous, simply eager to have a few good Aha! moments along the way.</p>
